# Customizing Your [!INCLUDE [d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Experience
[!INCLUDE [d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is designed to help you run your business, regardless which line of business you are in. At the core of [!INCLUDE [d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you find financial reporting and sales and purchasing processes. You add experiences to that according to your business needs by adding extensions from AppSource or by changing the Experience setting for your company. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md), or the *Choosing a User Experience* section below.

## Choosing a User Experience to Show or Hide Features
The user experience determines how much of the core functionality is available when you and your colleagues use [!INCLUDE [d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. You can choose the user experience for your company in the **Company Information** window, in the **Experience** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> This setting applies to all users in your company. Users can customize their own experience even further by changing page layouts and content. For more information, see [Personalizing Your Workspace and Pages](ui-personalization-user.md).  

The following table lists the experiences that are currently available.

| Experience | Impact on User Interface |
| --- | --- |
| **Basic** |Shows only core actions and fields within the most common business functionality, such as sales, purchasing, inventory, and finance. |
| **Essential** |Shows all actions and fields for all common business functionality.|

> [!NOTE]  
> With the Sandbox option, you can select the **Advanced** experience, which gives access to all possible business functionality, including Manufacturing and Service Management. For more information, see [Create a Sandbox Environment](across-how-create-sandbox-environment.md).
