# Business Central Intelligent Cloud Extensions

If you are using one of the supported on-premises products, you can configure your intelligent cloud environment based on a product-specific extension.Â Once your intelligent cloud environment is configured, you will be able to replicate data from your on-premises solution to your [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] cloud tenant. This will enable you to take full advantage of what the cloud has to offer your business such as, enhanced insights into your business, artificial intelligence, multiple device access, and anytime, anywhere access.  

## Business Central on-premises
If you are using an on-premises deployment of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], get the **Intelligent Cloud Base** extension and the **Business Central Intelligent Cloud** extension, and follow the guides in both.  

## Dynamics GP
If you are using Dynamics GP, get the **Intelligent Cloud Base Extension** extension, the **Dynamics GP Data Migration** extension, and the **Dynamics GP Intelligent Cloud**, and follow the guides in all three.
