# Set Up Tax Accounting
Tax accounting lets you apply rules for recognizing income and expenses that follow your local tax laws. You can activate tax accounting features in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] by setting up tax registers.  

## To activate tax accounting  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Tax Register Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **General** FastTab, select codes for the following dimensions.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Condition Dimension Code**|Select a dimension code that describes the condition of the tax register.|  
    |**Kind Dimension Code**|Select a dimension code that describes the type of tax register.|  

3.  Select the following fields to activate entries in the tax register.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Create Acquis. FA Tax Ledger**|Select to create fixed asset acquisition entries.|  
    |**Create Reclass. FA Tax Ledger**|Select to create fixed asset reclassification entries.|  
    |**Create Acquis. FE Tax Ledger**|Select to create future expense acquisition entries.|  

4.  Select the appropriate depreciation books in the **Tax Depreciation Book** and **Future Exp. Depreciation Book** fields. The depreciation books that you select should not be integrated with the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] finance module.
