# Customer Card and Vendor Card Fields
The **Customer Card** and **Vendor Card** windows include several additional fields. The **Default Bank Code** field has been added to the **Payments** FastTab on both cards, and the following fields have been added to the **Invoicing** FastTab in the **Vendor Card** window:  

- **KPP Code**  
- **OKPO Code**  
- **OKONX Code**  

Every company uses these codes, and they must be shown in required documents such as payment documents and factura-invoices.  

- The **KPP Code** field is for the code of the company registration.  
- The **OKPO Code** field is for the Classification of Enterprises and Organizations code.  
- The **OKONX Code** field is for a federation-wide classifier of a sector of the national economy.  

The KPP code has also been added to the **Payments** FastTab of the **Customer Card** window.  

Each customer can specify several bank accounts in the **Customer Bank Account** window, but there is usually one default bank account for most of a customer's payments. This most widely used bank account can be selected in the **Default Bank Code** field. The same applies for vendors.  

The **Default Bank Code** field is added to the **Payments** FastTab of the customer card and the vendor card.
