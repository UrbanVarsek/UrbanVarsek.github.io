# Set Up Corrective Invoicing
You can create corrective invoices and corrective credit memos to reflect changes in quantity and amounts after the items were shipped or received. First, you must set up [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] with prerequisites.  

## To set up number series for corrective documents  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Sales & Receivables Setup** window, on the **Numbering** tab, specify the number series that must be used for posted corrective invoices and credit memos.  

## To set up inventory posting groups  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Inventory Posting Groups**, and choose the related link.
2.  In the **Inventory Posting Groups** window, in the **Sales Corr. Doc. Charge (Item)** field, select the item charge code that you want to use in in value entries to correct the original price of items in the corrective documents.  

You can set up a separate code for each inventory posting group.
