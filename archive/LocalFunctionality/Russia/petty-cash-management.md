## Ingoing Cash Orders  
To use the ingoing cash order feature, create one general journal template with the Cash Order Payment type. There can be several cash accounts in the company, and several cash points (for example cashiers) for each cash account. For each cash account, you must create a cash account with the Cash Account Card feature.  

For each cash point, create a General Journal batch. The value of the **Balance Account Type** field of the batch line should be chosen as Bank Account, and the appropriate cash account should be entered in the **Balance Account Number** field.  

The following procedure shows how to access the **Ingoing Cash Order** window.  

-   In **Financial Management**, choose **Cash Management**, and then choose **Ingoing Cash Orders**.  

 To create a new ingoing cash order, or to work with an existing unposted cash order, choose the correct batch name (and accordingly the cash point) in the **Cash** field. This field is required and matches the **Batch Name** field in financial journals. The **Ingoing Cash Order** window contains the fields listed in the following table.

To print an outgoing cash order window after it has been posted; you can run a report that prints the same window from check ledger entries using the **Print** action. It has no parameters. Before printing, the report ensures that this is really an outgoing cash order, and not an ingoing cash order or bank payment.  

## Cash Order Journal CO-3 Report  
The **Cash Order Journal CO-3** report shows the register of posted ingoing and outgoing cash orders during some reporting period in the unified standard printing window that is certified by Russian accounting legislation. For more information, see [Print the Cash Order Journal CO-3 Report](how-to-print-the-cash-order-journal-co-3-report.md).  

## Cash Additional Sheet Reports  
The **Cash Additional Sheet** and **Cash Additional Sheet (Curr.)** reports show the unified standard printing windows for the cash booking register for one operational day of the cash account. These reports are usually printed every day, and their numbering continues according to the value of the **Last Cash Report Page No.** field in the corresponding cash account card. The reports increase that number by one and use this number as a page number of the report (but only if the report parameter Repeat Printing is not selected). They can only be printed per day.  

They both show the opening balance of all the posted ingoing and outgoing cash orders, and the closing balance of an operational day for one cash account. The difference between them is that the **Cash Additional Sheet (Curr.)** report is for cash accounts in a currency other than the local currency.  

To access the reports  

Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Cash Additional Sheet** or **Cash Additional Sheet (Curr.)**, and then choose the related link.  

The parameters of the reports are listed in the following table.

|Date|Enter the operation date of the cash account for printing in the report.|  
|Repeat printing|Select this field to ensure that the printing process does not increase the value of the **Last Cash Report Page No.** field in the corresponding cash account card and that the report is printed with this number (indicated in the cash account card). This serves repeated printing.|
