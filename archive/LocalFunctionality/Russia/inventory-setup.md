# Inventory Setup
As part of inventory management, you can set up inventory to:  

- Assign item charges on purchases from foreign countries/regions based on weight or volume.  
- Use the same column for original and corrective postings.  

## Item Charge Assignment in Purchase Documents  
In Russia, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] can assign item charges on purchases from foreign countries/regions based on weight or volume. For each item, in the **Item Card** window, on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab, if the **Gross Weight Mandatory** and **Unit Volume Mandatory** check boxes are selected, you must fill in the **Gross Weight** and **Unit Volume** fields. When you suggest an item charge assignment on a purchase order, you must specify that the distribution principle, weight, and volume are added to the options to choose from. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](../../payables-how-assign-item-charges.md).

## Item Corrections  
You can set up inventory to use the same column for original and corrective postings. This is often referred to as *red storno*.  

You can use red storno posting to post corrections for the following inventory entries:  

- Corrective entries in the item journal.  
- Reversal of item documents such as item receipts and item shipments.  
- Posting item revaluation or item reclassification journals.  
- Periodic adjustments of item costs.  

For more information, see [Post Red Storno Corrections](how-to-post-red-storno-corrections.md).  

### Adjusting Item Cost  
If you select the Enable Red Storno field in the **Inventory Setup** window, then negative deviations are posted according to red storno when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.
