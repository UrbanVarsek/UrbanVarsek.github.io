# Create Corrective Documents
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can create corrective invoices and credit memos to reflect a change in the invoiced amount or quantity.  

 You can also create revision documents if you discover a mistake in an issued invoice or credit memo.  

 The following procedure shows how to create a corrective sales invoice, but the same steps apply to sales credit memos, purchase invoices, and purchase credit memos.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot create corrective documents for service documents.  

## To create a corrective invoice  

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Corrective Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    Some fields are filled in automatically when you select a customer. Other fields you must fill in manually. You must make sure that the values of fields such as **Prices Including VAT** and **Currency Code**, relevant dimensions, and so on are the same in the corrective document as in the original invoice.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  On the **Invoicing** tab, fill in the **Agreement No.** field if you have set up an agreement. For more information, see [Set Up Customer and Vendor Agreements](how-to-set-up-customer-and-vendor-agreements.md).  

3.  On the **VAT** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Additional VAT Ledger Sheet**|Optionally, select to include this document in the additional VAT ledger. For more information, see [VAT Ledgers](vat-ledgers.md).|  
    |**Corrected Document Date**|If you selected the **Additional VAT Ledger Sheet** field, specify the posting date of the document that you are correcting.<br /><br /> This ensures that the original invoice is listed as canceled in the additional sheet for the sales VAT book in the relevant report period.|  
    |**Corrective Document**|Select to make this document a corrective document.|  
    |**Corrective Doc. Type**|Choose **Correction** to make this a correction to an invoice.|  
    |**Corrected Doc. Type**|Specify if the original document was an invoice or a credit memo.|  
    |**Corrected Doc. No.**|Specify the original document.<br /><br /> Depending on the value of the **Corrected Doc. Type** field, you can select a posted invoice or a posted credit memo.|  
    |**Revision No.**|Optionally, specify a revision number if this document is a revision of a corrective document.|  

4. Choose the **Get Corr. Doc. Lines** action.  
5.  In the **Sales Invoice Lines** window, select the lines that you want to add to the corrective documents, and then choose the **OK** button.  
6.  In the dialog box that appears, specify if the correction if for quantity or price.  
7.  Make the appropriate changes to the document lines. For example, to change the invoiced amount, change the value of the **Amount (After)** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the document line is for an item, you can only change the value of the **Amount (After)** field. If the document line is for an item charge, you can change the value of the **Quantity (After)** field and the **Amount (After)** field.  

8.  Post the document.  

    The posted document is included in the list of posted invoices. This means that you can select it in the **Corrected Doc. No.** field if you must create a correction for this corrected document.  

The following procedure describes how to create a revision for a posted sales invoice but the same steps apply to sales credit memos, purchase invoices, purchase credit memos, and corrective documents.  

## To create a revision document for a sales invoice  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.
3.  Choose the **Copy Document** action.  
4.  In the **Copy Sales Document** window, fill in the fields to import information from the original sales invoice.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Select the **Include Header** field.  

5.  On the **VAT** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Additional VAT Ledger Sheet**|Optionally, select to include this document in the additional VAT ledger. For more information, see [VAT Ledgers](vat-ledgers.md).|  
    |**Corrected Document Date**|If you selected the **Additional VAT Ledger Sheet** field, specify the posting date of the document that you are revising.<br /><br /> This ensures that the original invoice is listed as canceled in the additional sheet for the sales VAT book in the relevant report period.|  
    |**Corrective Document**|Select to make this document a corrective document.|  
    |**Corrective Doc. Type**|Choose **Revision** to make this a revision document.|  
    |**Corrected Doc. Type**|Specify if the original document was an invoice or a credit memo.|  
    |**Corrected Doc. No.**|Specify the original document.<br /><br /> Depending on the value of the **Corrected Doc. Type** field, you can select a posted invoice or a posted credit memo.|  
    |**Revision No.**|Specify a revision number.<br /><br /> The revision number is not used by [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)], but it is included in the printed document.|  

6.  Make the relevant changes to the document lines.  
7.  Post the document.  

The posted document is included in the list of posted invoices. This means that you can select it in the **Corrected Doc. No.** field if you must create a correction for this corrected document.
