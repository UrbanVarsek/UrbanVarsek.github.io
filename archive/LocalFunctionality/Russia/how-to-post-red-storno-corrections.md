# Post Red Storno Corrections
You can set up inventory to use the same column for original and corrective postings. This is often referred to as *red storno*. You can use red storno posting to post the following inventory entries:  

- Corrective entries in the item journal.  
- Reversal of item documents such as item receipts and item shipments.  
- Posting item revaluation or item reclassification journals.  
- Periodic adjustments of item costs.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You must enable red storno in the **Inventory Setup** window before you can post corrective entries. For more information, see [Inventory Setup](inventory-setup.md).
